xptMiner
========



This includes all the optimisations that are around, and donations to everyone.. 




xptMiner is a multi-algorithm miner and reference implementation of the xpt protocol. It currently supports Protoshares, Metiscoin and Scrypt (slow)

For this project I tried to focus on clean code as well merging all the various algorithms into a single project. While performance is only secondary, I'll do speed optimizations if time allows.


for now here's a windows executables


Note this is not the one of the version here :)

This has a 1% donation which can be set using the -d option (-d 2.5 would be 2.5% donation)

HELP NEEDED 

My work has been based on the major optimisations of the fugue algorithm found here:

https://github.com/betaxx/xptMinerOpt

This gives you  50% speed of current BUT does not match the shares ;) So have a look and see if you can help
